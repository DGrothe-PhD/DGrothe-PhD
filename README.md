### Hi there 👋 To write code, for me, is:
To translate — but in a different way. Doing some magic! 🪄\
Always looking on the bright side of life, or a user's screen — and at the dark-mode page of code, too. \
I love this way of thinking both of the scrutiny of details and of the bigger picture traversing layer after layer of a full code stack.

- ✨ From visuals from my head into text into visuals at a coworker's head.
- ✨ From text or code into visuals in my head into fixing bugs. 💡
- ✨ From code into life — that of a user seeing how their life can improve.
- ✨ Thereby, I have become somebody new as well. ✨

People also know me as 📙 [**The Fluttering Dev that can C#**](https://danielagrothe.substack.com/) on Substack.
